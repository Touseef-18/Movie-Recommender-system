# Movie-Recommender-system
I designed and implemented a movie recommender system using Jupyter Notebook, focusing on content-based filtering and natural language processing (NLP). The system utilized cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their plot summaries and user preferences. This involved preprocessing textual data to extract meaningful features and compute similarity scores between movies. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in NLP techniques, cosine similarity computation, and integrating machine learning algorithms for personalized recommendations. This project not only sharpened my skills in data preprocessing and algorithm implementation but also showcased my ability to deliver practical solutions in recommendation systems
